# SuperSimpleDev Code-Along / AmazonProject

Javascript code-along with SuperSimpleDev's JavaScript FullCourse Youtube Videos. 
These videos contain 15h+ of high quality content and exercises.

## The main topics are:

  - JavaScript Sintax and Logic
  - Functions and Modules
  - DOM
  - Problem Solving
  - Git

*There were more projects on this course, but I choose to only upload this one on GitHub as the others were more like stepping stones*
